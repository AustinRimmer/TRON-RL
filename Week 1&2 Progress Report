The last 2 weeks we went over planning our env demo and what we'll be using in it:
We're going to use MCTS
Each agent will have access to:
Board: 64x64
Cell states: 1 or 0 (free or trail)
Directions: 3 (cant go backwards due to trail)
W/L state + total
Reward Structure:
For each move the agent makes that extends survival, there will be a discount, so that agents are more incentivized to end the game by attacking each other.
Loses -50 (subject to change to adjust behaviour)
Wins +50 (subject to change to adjust behaviour)
Ties 0
Note: W/L not discounted, we're thinking about letting agents have W/L totals
tile: +1, 70% discount as previously mentioned
What we all did: decided on algorithm, researched what we’ve learnt so far, determined computationally viable approach to our env.

Austin:
What I did: 
  - set up git
  - initial commit and read me
  - set meeting time, added git collaborators
What I’ll do: 
  - collaboratively develop env 
  - set up custom Gym Environment
  - experiment with Gym

Sahel:
What I did:
  Research different solutions and strategies for beating TRON:
    - Cutting off opponents
    - Moving to open areas for survivability
    - Staying close to walls to ‘thread the needle’ and find escape routes.
What I plan to do:
  Code reward structure and figure out weights and discounts

Rayhan:
What I did: 
  Created the initial reward structure to follow  
What I plan to do:
  Implement MCTS algorithm

Teniola:
What I did:
  Research and discuss different algorithms and methods to solve TRON
What I plan to do:
  Collaboratively develop the environment and integrate the grid world into MCTS
