Week 5
- asked TA and prof for guidance on project novelty direction (Group 35)
- implemented a power-up in the environment (Teniola & Sahel)
  power-up includes a speed boost that allows a bike to travel 2 units
- Worked on Dyna-Q implementation (Rayhan & Austin)

Week 6
- Planning training and project presentation (Group 35)
- Finalizing Dyna-Q algorithm (Rayhan & Austin)
- Finalizing MCTS algorithm (Sahel & Teniola)

Plans for the Future
- Set up/research performance metrics to compare our algorithms against each other
- train agents and compare performance
- Create a presentation of our findings on how each algorithm fares, and record a video detailing the project
- Have fun
